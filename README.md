## What is Gwent?
Gwent is a minigame from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt that consists of two players with a deck of cards. Each player starts with two lives and adds cards to the board with the intent of beating the opponent's score and removing a life at the end of each round. The game is won when the opponent loses both lives.

## Features

### Deck Builder
The deck menu is used to select a faction and create a deck from the available cards to use in the game. To start with, only a few low-level cards are unlocked - limiting the strength of the deck and making winning difficult. To build a stronger deck, the player needs to unlock more cards by playing games.

### Inspecting Cards
Right-clicking a card will enlarge it and display a description of its ability. Inspecting a card that targets another card will display that card to the side.

### Settings Menu
The settings can be used to customise the gameplay to personal preference, such as enabling or disabling leader cards.

### Gameplay
Starting a new game will display a board and the player’s chosen deck. The board can be interacted with when it’s the player’s turn by clicking on the cards within the deck hand. Pressing the space bar will pass the round, and the round will end if both players have passed, with the loser losing a life.

Cards are placed on the board depending on their range and abilities. The card’s strength and ability (if it has one) are calculated, and the board updates. The recent cards added to the board by the player and opponent are displayed next to the leaders, so the player is aware of the recent additions to the board.

The graveyard contains standard cards that have been removed from the board can be opened and closed by clicking the card to the left of the deck pile. It also opens when a medic ability is used to recover a chosen card.

Once a player has no lives left, an end screen is displayed showing the result and the scores in each round.
